# Isometric3D
3D engine using isometric projection.
Uses the Window library to display the 2D graphics.
The main class only executes, calculation.java has all the calculation functions needed to transform 3D object to 2D image with isometric projection.(Most of the calculations and important stuff happen in Entity3D)
